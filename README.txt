Use this template to produce a standard thesis that meets the University
requirements for DPhil submission, and should be passable for other thesis-based
degrees (e.g. MPhil) as well.

In modern LaTeX implementations, you should be able to open main.tex with
your favorite editor and compile it.  By default, this template uses biber/BibLaTeX
for references / citations, so you may have to make the appropriate changes in
your build preferences. Make a full build using 'latexmk' by simply typing 'latexmk' 
(see latexmkrc for reference). Run 'latexmk -C' to clean temporary output files and 
initialize the '.aux' directory. A typical manual full build should be:
1. pdflatex main.tex
2. biber main
3. pdflatex main.tex
4. pdflatex main.tex

There should be subfolders called 'text' and 'figures'.  Keep all your work in these
folders.  This will make your life much simpler when you need to go about deleting
files creating while compiling while not deleting your actual thesis.

Make a new .tex file for each chapter and appendix, and place them in the 'text'
folder.  If you'll have a figure-intensive thesis, subfolders in 'figures' is a good
idea.  Use PDF graphics if at all possible.

The LaTeX cheat sheet is your friend.  Google it.  http://tex.stackexchange.com has
lots of answers to common LaTeX problems.
